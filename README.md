Plex Helper Scripts for Linux Servers
=====================================

These are some scripts I'm using in the meantime to manage my unruly, stupid,
temporary Plex setup while I replace hard drives..

This is the fingerprint for Plex Inc's repository:

        CD665CBA0E2F88B7373F7CB997203C7B3ADCA79D

What it does is creates a kill script and a status watching script for using
Plex Media Server with sysv init instead of systemd or upstart.
